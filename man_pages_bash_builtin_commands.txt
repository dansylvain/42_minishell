cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
============================
Change the current directory to dir. If dir is not supplied, the value of the HOME shell variable is the default. Any additional arguments following dir are ignored.

The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing dir: each directory name in CDPATH is searched for dir. Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:). A null directory name in CDPATH is the same as the current directory, i.e., ``.''. If dir begins with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.

The -P option causes cd to use the physical directory structure by resolving symbolic links while traversing dir and before processing instances of .. in dir (see also the -P option to the set builtin command); the -L option forces symbolic links to be followed by resolving the link after processing instances of .. in dir.

If .. appears in dir, it is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component from dir, back to a slash or the beginning of dir. If the -e option is supplied with -P, and the current working directory cannot be successfully determined after a successful directory change, cd will return an unsuccessful status.

On systems that support it, the -@ option presents the extended attributes associated with a file as a directory.

An argument of - is converted to $OLDPWD before the directory change is attempted. If a non-empty directory name from CDPATH is used, or if - is the first argument, and the directory change is successful, the absolute pathname of the new working directory is written to the standard output.

The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed; false otherwise.



echo [-neE] [arg ...]
=====================
Output the arguments, separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The return status is 0 unless a write error occurs. If -n is specified, the trailing newline is suppressed. If the -e option is given, interpretation of the following backslash-escaped characters is enabled. The -E option disables the interpretation of these escape characters, even on systems where they are interpreted by default.

The xpg_echo shell option may be used to dynamically determine whether or not echo expands these escape characters by default. echo does not interpret -- to mean the end of options.

echo interprets the following escape sequences:
\a     alert (bell)
\b     backspace
\c     suppress further output
\e, \E  an escape character
\f     form feed
\n     new line
\r     carriage return
\t     horizontal tab
\v     vertical tab
\\     backslash
\0nnn  the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (zero to three octal digits)
\xHH   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits)
\uHHHH the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits)
\UHHHHHHHH
       the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits)



exit [n]
========
Cause  the  shell  to  exit with a status of n.  If n is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed.  A trap on EXIT is executed before the shell terminates.



export [-fn] [name[=word]] ...
export -p
==============================
The supplied names are marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands. If the -f option is given, the names refer to functions. If no names are given, or if the -p option is supplied, a list of names of all exported variables is printed.

The -n option causes the export property to be removed from each name. If a variable name is followed by =word, the value of the variable is set to word.

export returns an exit status of 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the names is not a valid shell variable name, or -f is supplied with a name that is not a function.




pwd [-LP]
=========
Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory. The pathname printed contains no symbolic links if the -P option is supplied or the -o physical option to the set builtin command is enabled. If the -L option is used, the pathname printed may contain symbolic links.

The return status is 0 unless an error occurs while reading the name of the current directory or an invalid option is supplied.



unset [-fv] [-n] [name ...]
===========================
For each name, remove the corresponding variable or function. If the -v option is given, each name refers to a shell variable, and that variable is removed. Read-only variables may not be unset. If -f is specified, each name refers to a shell function, and the function definition is removed.

If the -n option is supplied, and name is a variable with the nameref attribute, name will be unset rather than the variable it references. -n has no effect if the -f option is supplied.

If no options are supplied, each name refers to a variable; if there is no variable by that name, a function with that name, if any, is unset. Each unset variable or function is removed from the environment passed to subsequent commands.

If any of BASH_ALIASES, BASH_ARGV0, BASH_CMDS, BASH_COMMAND, BASH_SUBSHELL, BASHPID, COMP_WORDBREAKS, DIRSTACK, EPOCHREALTIME, EPOCHSECONDS, FUNCNAME, GROUPS, HISTCMD, LINENO, RANDOM, SECONDS, or SRANDOM are unset, they lose their special properties, even if they are subsequently reset.

The exit status is true unless a name is readonly.
